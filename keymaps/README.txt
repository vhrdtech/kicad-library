The wonderful world of hotkeys!

Ok, so included here are two key mapping files.  I've tried to only leave what I actually specified in the videos, in there.

I did my best with the QWERTY but it's not the keyboard I use, so buyer beware--just backup your existing, then check things post-import.

The process is:

 * open up a KiCad schematic
 * go to Preferences -> Preferences -> Hot Keys
 * click the "Open Preferences Directory" and backup the "user.hotkeys" file somewhere, assuming you have set things up you'd like to be able to restore
 * at the bottom of the dialog, there's an "Import Hotkeys..." button, use that 
 
Choose your poison: most will probably be using the QWERTY keyboard, so "kicadunlocked_map-qwerty.hotkeys"

It's just a text file, regardless of the (obligatory) suffix so you can peak inside and see what you want to keep prior to importing.  The sadness is that it isn't always obvious what foo.bar.someoption will map to in the dialog, but the filter search thing is pretty handy.

I do suggest you also get the SVG file, it really helps to have a cheatsheet while learning.

Cheerio!
